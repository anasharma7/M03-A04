Project Overview
The Court Case Management System is designed to automate the process of assigning legal cases to judges. It utilizes the Strategy design pattern to allow for flexible case assignment strategies based on the court's needs. This system supports user authentication and provides a navigation mechanism to demonstrate the case assignment use case.

Getting Started
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Java JDK installed and an IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ, or VS Code) that supports Java development.
Download: Download the zipped project from Canvas and unzip it to your preferred location.
Import Project: Open your IDE and import the project.
Run Application: Navigate to the src directory and run the Main.java file to start the application.

Using the Application
Login: Upon launch, the application will prompt for user login. Enter the credentials as instructed.
Case Assignment: After successful login, you will be directed to the case assignment demonstration. Follow the on-screen prompts to see cases assigned to judges using different strategies.

Design Patterns
This project demonstrates the use of the Strategy design pattern to allow for dynamic case assignment strategies. The implementation details are as follows:

Strategy Pattern: Allows changing the case assignment strategy at runtime.
Implemented in: CaseAssignmentStrategy, RandomAssignmentStrategy, LoadBalancedAssignmentStrategy, CaseAssigner
